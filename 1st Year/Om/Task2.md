## How other branches like Electrical, Mechanical & Automobile is related to Computer Science
### Electrical:
*CS and Electrical needs to work side by side especially for Arduino and for Agreement both departments needs to consult each other. Same in CS. The isolation of problems, troubleshooting is remarkably similar. The design of systems, circuits, programs, software, I/O, GUIâ€™s and networks is also very similar - in fact, they often use similar tools - flow diagrams, process charts and schematics. Computer Science is like a combination of Mathematics and Electrical Engineering. Computer hardware is often designed by EEs. So overall we can say Computer Science and Electrical is dependent on each other.*

### Mechanical:
*For mechanical group, cse and mechanical domain need to collaborate for sensor and camera placement in the car.  Mechanical domain will decide where we can fit camera ,sensor and everything and wherever it is feasible.*
### Corporate
*Corporate provide us with sponsors .*
