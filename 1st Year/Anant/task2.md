# How other branches like Electrical, Mechanical & Automobile is related to Computer Science


## 1. ELECTRICAL :bulb::electric_plug::

**Computer science and electrical engineering are very closely related . The people in these two fields work closely together to design hardware at the same time as designing the software to run on it. For example, when Apple designs a new iPhone or MacBook model, electrical engineers work together with computer scientists to design low-level computer code that runs as efficiently as possible on the hardware.**

## 2. MECHANICAL :red_car::gear::

**Computer science and mechanical engineering both involve the design, development, and testing of tools for public use. Each of these professionals works to identify and solve problems using systems, modeling, and mathematics.
With the help of a mechanical engineer, the creation of physical tools might be possible, but it would be nothing without the assistance of the computer scientist and vice-versa.**

## 3. CORPORATE :handshake::handshake::

**The corporate domain will help in the proper marketing and in getting sponsors for projects of Computer Engineering people.Without sponsors and proper funding, the ideas and project may not be success.Hence to complete such needs a corporate domain is required.**
