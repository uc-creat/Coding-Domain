## How are Mechanical, Electrical and Cooperate Domains important to Computer Science Domain?   

### Mechanical:
* Mechanical domain creates physical bodies or products and computer science domain will create on how the physical product works. So in simple terms mechanical domains make the body and computer science domain implant a soul into the products. This is very essential for even the most basic things. Without Mechanical branch it will be impossible for computer science to create a product with maximium efficency and least cost. Similarly without computer science the give product wont function upto the required needs. As we progress into the future more and more products like IOT and robotics is very essential for the existance of human beings.

### Electrical:
* Computer Science is nothing but the Software form of Electrical Engineering. Once upon a time EE was sufficent for everything as majority of the devices were based on analog technology which was more dependent on electrical engineering. In order to increase accuracy and efficieny some form of logic reasoning, programming, etc. is required to convert them from analog to digital. From that time electrical and computer science were inter dependent with each other. Everything like a microchips, motherboard, processors, (all semiconductor chips) required some form of computer science engineering innovation.

### Coperate:
