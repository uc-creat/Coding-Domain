# How do the Corporate, Mechanical and electric domains help the coding domain.?

---

As we know that nowdays the hybrid car or the electric car concept is trending, so we start by taking the example of the electric car.
Let's consider that a company named XYZ is planning to make a electric car, and they are ready with the blueprint of the car's design. 
Now it's time to get started with the field work and for that thay need the frame of the car and then they will need the mechanical parts such as gear setup, steering wheel etc, 
and this will be made available by a team of Mechanincal Engineers. Once the company is ready with the mechanical parts they need to figure out the new addition i.e, the hybrid/electric feature.
They need to plan out things such as what amount of electric power will be required for the car to run smoothly on battery and how the other parts of the car such as the console, lights etc will draw power from the batter and how they can optimize this, here the electrical team comes into play. The team of electrical engineers will figure out solutions to all the questions raised regarding the power and battery.
Now the company needs to add features such as the parking sensors, automatic headlamps, automatic wipers, curise control system etc. and all these features require sensors to sense the need of a particular feature so that they can work and these all things are dealt by the team of programmers who write the code so that the sensors can function properly.

The above scenario tells us how the different domains(mechanical, electrical, and coding) contribute in a project to make it successful but still there si more to it. Let's consider that the company fixed the weight of the car at *x kgs* and the company is very strict with the physical parameters of the vehicle, but the weight of the car exceeds the decided weight by a few kgs and the company is not at all ready to compromise with the weight oof the car as it can affect the performance. Now, all the domains will have to work with each other in order to reduce the weight of the car. The mechanical team will look to reduce the weight of the physical components, they can change the material of some of the parts to a material with lighter weight if possible. The electrical team will try to reduce the weight of the battery and other electrical stuff included in the car and the coding team will see if they can cut down few grams in order to control the overall weight of the car. 
Now let us consider that the car is ready and all the features have been included, but still a very important part of the project remains, i.e, Presenting it to the outside world. Here the corporate team comes in to play. The corporate team figures out the best way possible to present it in such a way that the company gets profitted for the project. They decide the advertisiing and marketing part of the project and the marketing and advertisment are some of the major parts of any project to make it successful. 
This clearly shows us how the mechanical, electric, codig and corporate domains are interdependent and they help each other in order to make a successful project.
